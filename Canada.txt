Canada
Canada is a country in North America. Its ten provinces
and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to
the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean,
making it the world's second-largest country by total
area, with the world's longest coastline. Its border with
the United States is the world's longest international land
border. The country is characterized by a wide range of
both meteorologic and geological regions. It is a sparsely
inhabited country of 40 million people, the vast majority
residing south of the 55th parallel in urban areas.
Canada's capital is Ottawa and its three largest
metropolitan 
areas 
are 
Toronto, 
Montreal, 
and
Vancouver.
Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is
now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the
16th century, British and French expeditions explored
and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a
consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded
nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In
1867, with the union of three British North American
colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as
a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an
accretion of provinces and territories and a process of
increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom,
highlighted by the Statute of Westminster, 1931, and
culminating in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the
vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the
United Kingdom.
Canada 
is 
a 
parliamentary 
democracy 
and 
a
constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The
country's head of government is the prime minister, who
holds office by virtue of their ability to command the
confidence of the elected House of Commons and is
"called upon" by the governor general, representing the
monarch of Canada, the head of state. The country is a
Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English
and French) in the federal jurisdiction. It is very highly
ranked in international measurements of government
transparency, quality of life, economic competitiveness,
innovation, education and gender equality. It is one of
the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural
nations, the product of large-scale immigration. Canada's
